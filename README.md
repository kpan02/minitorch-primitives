MiniTorch is a ground-up implementation of PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework used for building and training neural networks. The project was built from scratch as part of the Machine Learning Engineering course at Cornell Tech, taught by Professor Sasha Rush.

**minitorch-primitives**: This module implements the foundational components of MiniTorch. It covers basic mathematical operators, functional programming tools like map, zipWith, and reduce, and introduces a lightweight module system for managing parameters. It also includes unit tests and property-based tests to ensure correctness throughout the framework.
